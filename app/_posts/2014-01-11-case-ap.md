title:  "Case Study: Aircraft Performance v3.0"
categories: Case-Study
---

This has proved to be one of the most popular applications created for Eurocontrol since I designed and built the first version in 2006.

It is important that Air Traffic Controllers understand the performance capabilities of aircraft they are monitoring. This application provides them with a reference tool to help them learn about those capabilities.

Version 1.0 provided search functions, detail displays, and an admin back-end. Version 2.0 was a rebuild replacing ASP with ASP.NET and MySQL with MS SQL.

Version 3.0 re-factored the application to make it tablet friendly (Flash graphs were replaced with images and an adaptive approach was adopted). Social sharing, course advertising and personalisation was also added (if the learner was logged on to the Learning Management System, they would be allowed to save custom lists of aircraft). Finally, a mobile version was also created.

### Spec

I was provided with a detailed, non-technical spec and asked to draw up the technical plans to work from.

It had to incorporate all the features mentioned above, be available to mobile devices and work in IE8 on XP as a minimum.

### Solution

Some parts of the solution I am very happy with although now (some years after completion), I would possibly take a different approach.

The custom groups has proved popular and is an excellent way to encourage users to sign up for the Learning Management System (credit must go to the Project Manager for that idea!)

A wide range of devices have been tracked using the application but I would still prefer one code base for maintenance. Therefore, if I was awarded the work to create the next version, I would take a detailed look into whether a responsive approach would be feasible (sometime it just isn't!)

### Technical

The desktop application was built using MS SQL and ASP.NET for the back end (and admin) with custom JavaScript and CSS, jQuery UI for the front end.

The mobile application used the same back end and an early version of jQuery Mobile for the front.

I built a small JavaScript library to communicate with the LMS API in order to log in.
LMS API and create a bridge for the Custom Groups feature.

I used AJAX calls to add, edit and delete custom data to the database. I built all this functionality using JavaScript.

### Outcome

The Aircraft Performance Databases has consistently been one of the most visited applications at the Eurocontrol IANS training institute over the years, which I think shows its training value.

The project manager was so happy with the work, he has given me an open reference to use in all future tenders.
