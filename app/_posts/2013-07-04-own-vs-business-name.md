I’ve been self-employed for about 12 years now, going by the superhero pseudonym of “websemantic”. An AWESOME business name, I’m sure you’ll agree.

I’ve wanted to change it for some time but, to be honest, my business name has had little impact on how I get work. So why change it?


The main confusion I faced when using a &#39;business&#39; name was letting people know what to expect. Am I a company? Do I have staff?
I found myself introducing my site as &#39;websemantic&#39; the business of Patrick Grey etc., just to let people know I was a one man band. It was awkward and unecessary.
So, I can see several benefits:

* By using my name, people instantly know they are dealing with one person.
* Exposure: when I&#39;m online as myself, I&#39;m also spreading recognition of my business.
* It&#39;s a better way to build relationships.
* I get to play with a new website and branding :-)

I did weigh up some possible disadvantages:

* Confusion as I change name.
* As my main business comes from existing relationships, now is an ideal time to change and avoid this.
* Potential clients may discount me for work as they presume it will be too large for one person.
* A little research would soon show them that I was a sole trader. Hopefully my portfolio will demonstrate the level of work I can deliver.
* Hassle: changing details with bank and tax authorities, hosting, stationary, email etc.
* Changing my digital profile is part of my job and was actually quite interesting to do. It was a good chance to tidy up and clean my &#39;workspace&#39;. HMRC and bank? I don&#39;t think they are too bothered but I will let them know and see how easy it is to change. Not much effort I suspect.
* I lose a relatively high Google ranking.
* Part of the job to get the new domain back up the listings and perhaps improve it for different search keywords.



Overall, I like the idea of having a refresh of my business. I can tidy things up and use the rebranding to try out new things. A new lick of paint gave me that excitiment I had when I started the business!
