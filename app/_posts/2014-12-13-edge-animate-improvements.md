This document blah, blah excerpt.

### Improvements

* When you duplicate a symbol, the new symbol as a new number appended to it e.g. "_1". I have to reselect that item in the library, right click and select Rename to give it the name I want. It would be better to leave a duplicated item name selected so I can change the name in one step if I need.

### Bugs
* If I move an item about the page and a keyframe is added to the timeline, the element will return 0 for CSS values like top or left. I have to remove the keyframe and then the element returns the correct value.
