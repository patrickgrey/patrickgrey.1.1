In 2012 the format of Flight Plans was to be updated. To prepare Flight Plan users across Europe for the change, Eurocontrol commissioned me to create a database application to allow users to explore the changes.

You can view the current version here: <a href="http://contentzone.eurocontrol.int/fpl/">http://contentzone.eurocontrol.int/fpl/</a>

Version 1.0 used Javascript to filter user selections in the browser, instead of on the server, to save a round trip and make the application respond almost instantly.

The Flight Plan Guide was initially aimed at a European audience but after it was recommended by ICAO, it reached a Worldwide audience:

* +53,000 unique visitors,
* +350,000 page views,
* from 187 different countries.

The site also included an admin back end using Dynamic Data ASP.NET MVC

All good websites should continue to evolve and in 2013, I was asked to add a new section that allowed users to review errors that they might receive when filing a flight plan. I made two proposals; extend the current approach or refactor the design incorporate what I had learnt about performance issues and make it responsive.

Thankfully, my client, in their wisdom :-) chose to make the application responsive.
