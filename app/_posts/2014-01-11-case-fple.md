<a href="/blog/case-study/2014/01/10/case-fpl.html" title="Select to read a short case study of the Flight Plan Guide V1.0 web application.">Version 1.0</a> of the tool was so popular Eurocontrol decided to expand the app's remit. They wanted to add a section allowing users to explore errors they could expect to receive if the Flight Plan had been incorrectly filed.

### Spec

Eurocontrol came to me with a general requirement to add an Errors section while retaining the version 1.0 features. I was asked to write the spec. I presented them with 2 detailed options, outlining the costs and benefits of each.

1. Adapt the current desktop and mobile applications to the new requirement.
2. Redsign from scratch, creating a responsive site and doing away with the need for dual applications - I had learned a wee bit more about responsive sites by now!

All good websites should continue to evolve and my client, in their wisdom :-), chose to make the application responsive.

### Solution

The new application is based on the 'Flat' design concept. I like this because it improves performance in the browser and can make for a very clean interface as long as everything is given appropriate space and balance.

I created a responsive design that would work on phone screens as well as desktops.

I refactored the JavaScript to make it even more efficient and tried to use native JavaScript instead of jQuery wherever possible.

On the details page I also added a 'step through' feature to allow users to step through the list of items they had filtered down to.

### Technical

I used jQuery Mobile for the interface as this is touch optimised and a better choice for a responsive design.

Offline is still achieved via HTML5 appcache: the manifest.appcache file is dynamic, written in ASP.NET. It queries the database for the last change time and date. This time and date is written into the appcache file as a comment. Therefore, if the appcache file changes in any way, this triggers a reload of the content to the local browser (using a JavaScript checking function in the browser).

This has the added benefit of improveing performance as new assets are only downloaded if there is a change on the server.

This approach can only be used for relatively small datasets as all the content has to be loaded onto the client side.
