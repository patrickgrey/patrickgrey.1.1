This was a small static site that Jock asked me to build to promote his architectural drawing business on the Island of Skye.

Jock wanted a simple site that would require minimal maintenance so I put most of my effort into the visual design. The design aims to reflect the high quality of his designs and emphasize his use of modern materials in an ancient landscape.

It was also important the site would have a high search ranking when people were looking for building design services on Skye. The site has had a top two placing, most commonly first, for a number of years.

I'm delighted with the site and it has helped my business with a high search engine ranking.&#8221;
