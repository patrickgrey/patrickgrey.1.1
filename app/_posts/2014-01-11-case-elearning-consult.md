I like to keep clients informed of the latest trends in e-learning and general web development. In 2013 Eurocontrol were still developing content in Flash and their systems were all based around desktop delivery. I suggested they needed to urgently start thinking about catering for non-desktop devices.

As a result, they asked me to put together a strategy paper stating the reasons a change should be made and how that change could be brought about.

My recommendations were adopted and the organisation is now moving towards a 'future-friendly' approach to e-learning development.

Furthermore, I was asked to produce reports evaluating the current LCMS for its mobile capabilities and Adobe Edge as a development tool to replace Flash. Adobe Edge is now being used for all major animated and interactive content development.
