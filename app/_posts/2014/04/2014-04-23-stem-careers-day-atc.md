I volunteered / was volunteered ;-) to attend a careers day at our primary school ([@KnoxlandSchool](https://twitter.com/KnoxlandSchool), Dumbarton). I develop e-learning for Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) so I thought I'd try to give them a fun introduction to the basics of the ATC as well as working with computers and being self-employed.

I attended the event as part of my [STEM Ambassador](http://www.stemnet.org.uk/ambassadors/why-become-a-stem-ambassador/) commitment for the year.

The format of the day had several groups of 10 children moving round a selection of people introducing their careers. It was brilliantly organized by the school and had volunteers from many backgrounds including RNLI, Theatre Nurse, Police, Fire and banking.

I organized a game where the children held up toy aircraft on a straw with a number attached to it. They all pointed in different directions within a set area. 

I built a small radar animation that made a noise each time a full radar sweep was completed and the kids had to then take a step forward.

One child wore ATC headphones and had to call out aircraft numbers and turn them to avoid collisions.

After the fun and inevitable multiple mid-air collisions followed by laughter (not quite how it happens in ATC), we discussed my work. The intelligence of the questions was surprising. What did I know about the recently missing MH370 flight? Who pays you when you are self-employed? How could they learn to build computer games?

I loved the event but was completely tired out after it. Our teachers have my every sympathy :-)

All in all, I think the day was a great success, helping the kids realise the variety of choice there is when it comes to careers and also proving hugely rewarding for those that got a chance to answer questions. Thanks to the teachers for organising it!

Local paper, the '[Lennox Herald](https://twitter.com/LennoxHerald)', featured the careers day, further promoting Knoxland as an active part of the community.
