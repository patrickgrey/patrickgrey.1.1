categories: Case-Study e-learning

This is the largest course I have completed single-handedly. It contains over 10 hours of learning. I was tasked with educational design, technical design and development (including editing several hours of video footage) and deployment.

A-CDM is is a common sense idea that is being introduced to airports internationally.

There is a lot of data about flight contained across many different systems at airports. Up until recently, that data was not being shared as much as it could be. A-CDM introduces guidance and processes to allow different airport professions share more of their data. This results in a much more efficient transit from landing to departure and can reduce delays.

 You can try this course by registering with the <a href="https://trainingzone.eurocontrol.int/" title="Open the Eurocontrol LMS website in a new window.">Eurocontrol LMS</a> and looking in the catalogue for "CDM".

This was an interesting challenge to take on. I was subcontracted by the Subject Matter Experts, <a href="http://www.integra.dk/" title="Open the Eurocontrol LMS website in a new window.">Integra</a>, who had won the contract to develop an e-learning course for A-CDM. They had already hired a company to produce the e-learning but, after several months, they were unable to deliver the content. Integra and Eurocontrol were left with very little digital content and completely unsuitable storyboards.

My first action was to inform my clients that, in my opinion, their course could not be delivered in the timescale they were aiming at. I had reviewed the existing storyboard and judged that it would need to be completely rewritten before any content could be created.

Happily the clients agreed with the new course of action and work got under way. As well as designing an entirely new storyboard with the SME, I designed and developed the course LMS navigation, all graphics and all animations. I also filmed over 5 hours of interviews, edited them and integrated them into a custom Flash video player I had built.

After a year of six day weeks, some long nights and enough coffee to fill a loch, the course was launched on time and on budget.
