Using Command Prompt to develop stuff makes me feel like the proper programmers you would see in <a href="http://youtu.be/B8dldLG_ZhI?t=35s" target="_blank">80s movies</a>.

Typing weird runes into a basic interface and then long lists speeding down the screen show that something important and impressive is happening. It looks like you have the capability to start World War 3 using only your ZX Spectrum. In reality, all you are doing is playing with advanced lego. You are plugging together small, focussed tools that other geniuses have built to improve your workflow.

I ignored the console for years. I didn&#39;t know how to use it. If they can&#39;t be bothered putting a GUI on it, why should I?

It turns out the beauty of the console is its simplicity. It forces you to keep software concepts and processes in your head. This gives you a better understanding of how things work and lets you work with the tools better and faster.

I use the console to manage GIT repositories and install, update and run web development frameworks like <a href="http://Yeoman.io" target="_blank">Yeoman.io</a> and <a href="http://DocPad.org" target="_blank">DocPad.org</a>.

All my projects are now backed up online and have version control thanks to GIT and <a href="http://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">bitbucket.org</a>. This means I can work on the same project on different machines, safe in the knowledge that I have a backup of all the versions I have made. All this for free - music to the ears of this Scotsman :-) This is just an example of the possible benefits.

With a little bit of learning I have found massive benefits to my daily work, which is why I would recommend you take the time to learn about using the console and these frameworks.

You will find that all the cool console stuff is aimed at Macs but I mainly develop on windows machines and have got everything working that I need to.

Try this out to get started:

* First learn the basics: how to navigate your file system.
* Then install a platform like <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> that will allow you to run these tools on it.
* Then install one of the tools like Yeoman and try running the basic settings. You will soon grasp the benefits.

The best way to learn is to try it.
