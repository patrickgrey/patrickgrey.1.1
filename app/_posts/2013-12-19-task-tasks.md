I want to better structure my workflow.

I use my personal projects to learn things. In web development, there is a never ending stream of things to learn. Unfortunately, I have a terrible tendancy to get distracted by shiny things. So, when I should be doing one task, I find a tool or technique that I can use in another part of the project. I sometimes move onto that as the solution is something sexy.

This slows my progress, muddles my workflow and probably reduces my learning.

I decided to get better organised with a structured workflow.

Tasks are a part of that workflow.

Web design can be a very fluid process; I may see a chance to improve my design, implement it and this has a knock on effect elsewhere. I need to stop jumping about but retain the ability to react to improvements in a fairly fluid way.

I started using tasks for that purpose:

* I create a task post to define the problem e.g. svg logo (I want to use SVG for my logo).
* A task should be a small enough chunk of work to complete quickly (a few hours) but large enough to be worthwhile documenting. If a task is too small, just mark it on git commit without a post.
* Task posts should be prefixed with 'task-'
* I commit that to git as the task start.
* I continue with that task, and that task only, until it is complete or I have to abandon it. I document what I learn as I go to note handy techniques and useful links.
* On completion I commit to git to mark the end of the task.

Extras:
* If I find a technique or tool that is specifically useful, I will document that in its own additional post.
* If some other part of the site is blocking this task or I REALLY need to move onto another thing, this documentation allows me to come back to the task with reasonable accuracy.

Benefits:
* I can note down where I get Open Source assets so I can correctly attribute them.

As long as I keep the tasks in chunks that are small enough to complete but large enough to document, I think it will be worthwhile.

Now to commit this...
