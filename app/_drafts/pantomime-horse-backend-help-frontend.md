Often, when I learn something that significantly improves my workflow or productivity, it is related to back-end programming.

What I mean by back-end.

As things get more complex, problems arise that have already been solved by back-end approaches.

Structure = maintainability, reusability = productivity.

Flash actionscript OO first experience of this.

Never thought I had the time to slow down and learn to do things properly but it always pays off in the medium to long term.

I wanted to improve the depth of my JS knowledge

I watched JavaScript: The Good Parts (url)

Too notes. Had to stop a short way in and read about what Doug Crockford was talking about. It was well worth it as I suddenly understood why a few different errors had been occuring that I had no idea as to the cause of. I also got a better understanding of things like closure, that I had read plenty about but didn't fully get without a good context.

Below are my notes - the notes are a write up of what I understood for the sources aimed at helping me remember and consolidate my learning. Therefore, if you want the theory, better to go to the original source.
