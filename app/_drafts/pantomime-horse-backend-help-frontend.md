The following are notes I made when trying to learn more about JavaScript fundamentals by watching Douglas Crockford's presentation.

<!--<style>
    .video-container {
        position: relative;
        padding-bottom: 56.25%;
        padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;
    }

    .video-container iframe,
    .video-container object,
    .video-container embed {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100%;
    }
</style>

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook](Doug Crockford's "JavaScript: The Good Parts").

You can get his book here: [http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742](http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742).

The notes cover Lambda/Functional programming, hoisting, first-class functions, Module Pattern, general good parts and bad parts. The notes are to help my memory and consolidate learning. As I'm still trying to understand this stuff and haven't practiced it enough to batter it into my thick head, so some (or much) of it may be wrong. You have been warned!

Before I get into the notes, a quick thought on why I'm learning this stuff. I'm a front-end developer who's got by with a decent understanding of how to use JavaScript but that wasn't really backed up with a deep knowledge of **how** it worked. I don't have a Computer Science background so I generally glazed over when discussions started getting 'deep'.

This is what I generally mean by 'back-end' here; Programmers that have a detailed  understanding of a language and which patterns solve common problems.

There are a couple of good reasons to learning more;


1. In the past, any time I've made the effort to learn 'back-end stuff', like OO in my ActionScript days, my confidence improved hugely, along with my productivity,
2. JavaScript is everywhere and it is increasingly becoming more central to my work.

I had to stop a short way into and read up about what Doug Crockford was talking about, which made me feel dumb. It was well worth it thought, as I suddenly understood a few errors that had previously baffled me. I also got a better understanding of things like closure, that I had read plenty about but didn't fully get without a good context.
