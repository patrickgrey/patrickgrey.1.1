I volunteered / was volunteered ;-) to attend a careers day at my local primary school (Knoxland, Dumbarton). I develop e-learning for Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) so I thought I'd try to give them a fun introduction to the basics of the ATC.

I intended to use this as part of my [STEM Ambassador](http://www.stemnet.org.uk/ambassadors/why-become-a-stem-ambassador/) commitment for the year.

### Planning

Resources:

* Foam aircraft
* Laptop with beep audio
* Tape or cones (check with school) to outline area
* Headset for ATC
* Ask school for permission to take photos for STEM and blog.

The format of the day was to have several groups of 10 children moving around a selection of people introducing them to a certain career.

My primary aim is to let the kids have fun but I also want them to learn something about the job. The ability to predict flight path conflicts is fairly fundamental to ATC so I focused on that.

I decided to base everything around a game where one child would act as an ATC and the rest would be aircraft. I set the 'aircraft' up in a limited area and pointed them in various directions so that a couple would probably end up on a collision course.

I bought some foam aircraft (which they could keep at the end) to hold up along with a number for each of the 'aircraft' children. Then I would set up my laptop to beep once every few seconds and the 'aircraft' would have to take a step forward. Once they reach the edge of the area, they would turn round and head in the opposite direction.

Depending on how the ATC was doing, I could slow down or speed up the beeps to make it easier / harder.

The ATCs job would be to call out the flight number and instruct them to change heading. To simplify things, they could choose left or right instead of degrees. The appropriate aircraft should confirm the instruction and change.

I wanted to make things hard enough that there would be a few fun collisions and a few kids would get a shot.

Before the game I gave a short introduction to the principles of ATC by asking questions about why we have rules of the road for cars. I then showed how the rules of air traffic are similar. Then we set up and start the game.

### Fallback

As with all new presentations or training that I haven't run before, I like to have some fall-back plans in case it isn't working out as I hoped when I start.

No collisions: I could simplify the game and use only three aircraft in smaller space and ask them to walk at a steady page. This should make 'turnover' of ATCs faster.

### Outcome
