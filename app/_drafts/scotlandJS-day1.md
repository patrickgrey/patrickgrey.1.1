The truth about Imposter Syndrome
by Angelina Fabbro


#Hi

Mouse stopped working!!

Really liked the web components talk by @zenorocha. Seems to be involved in Yeoman!

Want to try building a drag and drop component. May be made up of several components and pep.js

zeno says you can nest components and get them to talk to each other. Would be good to research and blog.

Use yeoman comonent generator.

Tasks
- define what you want it to do
- optionally add extra features if you can think of them and start a basic version.
- Create a github repo and yeoman scaffold into it
- I want to have testing added as I go. Check if the generator will do that, if not, see if we can combine generators and if not, try to implement casper.
    - read the bloody testing book you bought!!!
- Maybe a multi choice would be better for starters!!! I think that was the original idea!
- This needs a question, a set of answers and matching feedback. Need multi choice / multi select
- Question could be optional as may use image etc.
- allow own tick/cross images/colour change?
