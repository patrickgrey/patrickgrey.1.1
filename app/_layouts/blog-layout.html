                            I initially wanted to use Jekyll Pagination but couldn't get that to work.
                            It was really buggy, Paginator variable was empty and, even though the page number pages were created,
                            they had the wrong number of posts in them and the same posts in each page.

                            Until I can get that working, the desktop solution is to list all blogs but only show excerpts for the first 10 or so, then show links for the rest.

                            For mobile, this creates too long a list and hides the Categories and Archive lists. In this case I will hide all posts after 20. I wanted to have a CSS only show hide toggle button but that is a hack and unreliable it seems.

                            Note this should be temporary until pagination is fixed.
